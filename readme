This repository was made for recreating my model used for DeepCognition's Soda Bottle Challenge. 
The dataset can be downloaded from DeepCognition's official website at https://deepcognition.ai/competitions/soda-bottle-label-detection.
The model - which was written in python (version 3.6.7) - was exported from Deep Learning Studio, the rest of the code was mostly based on:

Sentdex's youtube tutorials on building a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and TensorFlow:

The TensorBoard logs can be found in the logs folder, however, the best-looking log can be found under this link:

The model was built using Keras 2.1.6.
Additional modules were used in this model such as python-OpenCV, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn.
