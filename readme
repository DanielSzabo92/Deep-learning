This repository was made for recreating my model used for DeepCognition's Soda Bottle Challenge.
The model - which was written in python (version 3.6.7) - was exported from Deep Learning Studio, the rest of the code was mostly based on:

Sentdex's youtube tutorials on building a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and TensorFlow:

Coursera "Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning":

The TensorBoard logs can be found in the logs folder.
The model was built using Keras 2.1.6.
Additional modules were used in this model such as python-OpenCV, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn.
